##NEW MESSAGE DIGEST ALGORITHM  TTH

new Message Digest algorithm called ‘tth’ which produces a variant Message digest output using the following mechanism. This problem introduces a hash function similar in spirit to SHA-512 that operates on letters instead of binary data. It is called the toy tetra graph hash (tth). Given a message consisting of a sequence of letters, tth produces a hash value consisting of four letters.
